# PlaygroundTV
This is a mock up for a safe streaming service for kids. It provides youngsters with fun and learning content while making sure they are safe and not being exposed to adult content, violence or extracting any form of data and information from them.

## UX and features
Focusing on kids and simplicity, with a vibrant and vivid colorscheme throughout. Essentially, what I focus on is getting from website to actually watching a video in as few clicks as possible. The first view (home) is a selection of series available, and as soon as one clicks on those one is taken directly to a playing video. 
The second part is grouping and structuring the content. This is done via Channels, where shows of the same age group or language are housed together. 
And lastly, we want people to be able to engage and rewatch their favorite shows. This is done via the "My Videos" page, where we will implement a full scale account structure in the future with the ability too bookmark videos they like.
